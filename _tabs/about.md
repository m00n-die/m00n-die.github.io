Hi, my name is Reginald Mawuko Amuzu (moondie) an aspiring Ethical Hacker.
I'm passionate about penetration testing and information security.

This blog serves as a platform to share my learnings, document my CTF experiences, and delve into the intricacies of cybersecurity.

I'm a graduate of ALX's Software Engineering program with a specialization in Backend Development and hold the TryHackMe Jr. Penetration Tester certification.

I aim to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical audiences, making cybersecurity concepts accessible and engaging for everyone.

Through this blog, I hope to build a strong personal brand and connect with like-minded individuals in the cybersecurity community.
